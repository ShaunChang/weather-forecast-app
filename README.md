## Router
Routing technology is used in the switch between the week page and the day page. In this way, the refresh of the page is completed by the dom controlled by js rather than by page jumping, which improves performance. At the same time, routing technology eliminates the problem of page jitter caused by page jumping, thus improving the user experience.
